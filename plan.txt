1. **Add Shooting Mechanism**:
   - Create a function `shoot()` in `enemyBot.js` that:
     - Instantiates a bullet object (spherical).
     - Sets the bullet's position to the bot's position.
     - Applies a velocity to the bullet in the direction the bot is facing.
     - Adds the bullet to the scene and manages its lifecycle (e.g., remove it after a certain distance or time).

2. **Implement HP Display**:
   - Create a property for each enemy to hold its HP.
   - Modify the bullet collision detection logic to check if a bullet hits an enemy.
   - If a bullet hits an enemy, reduce the enemy's HP and display it on the screen (e.g., using a simple text overlay or a health bar).

3. **Update Rendering Logic**:
   - Ensure that the shooting and HP display logic is integrated into the game loop for continuous updates.

4. **Testing**:
   - Test the shooting mechanism to ensure bullets are fired correctly.
   - Test the HP display to ensure it only shows when the enemy is hit.
